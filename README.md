# 🧠 NSGM: NeuroSymbolic Graph Memory

The open-source memory engine for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Fusing symbolic logic, neural embeddings, and dynamic graph memory for lifelong, explainable intelligence.

## 🚀 Overview

**NSGM (NeuroSymbolic Graph Memory)** is a hybrid memory system that enables AI agents to **learn, reason, and remember** like humans.

Built for the next generation of AGI systems, NSGM integrates:
- 🔗 **Symbolic logic** (relations, concepts, rules)
- 🧠 **Neural embeddings** (language, vision, multimodal)
- 🌐 **Dynamic memory graphs** that evolve over time

> Think of it as the “hippocampus + cortex” for intelligent systems.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Hybrid Nodes**: Symbolic labels + vector embeddings
- 🔄 **Dynamic Graph Memory**: Add, forget, reinforce, compress knowledge
- 🧠 **Reasoning Core**: Support for logic rules and semantic similarity
- 🧭 **Goal-Aware Queries**: Memory responds contextually
- ⌛ **Temporal Decay & Attention**: Prioritize important memories
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Plug in any encoder, LLM, or logic backend
